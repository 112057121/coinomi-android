===============

Welcome to the Coinomi Wallet app for Android!

## Building the app

Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html). Once it is running, import coinomi-android by navigating to where you cloned or downloaded it and selecting settings.gradle. When it is finished importing, click on the SDK Manager ![SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/images/tools/sdk-manager-studio.png). 

You will need to select every version from the latest down to Android 2.3 and install, which will take some time.

Once it is finished installing, you will need to enable developer options on your phone. To do so, go into settings, About Phone, locate your Build Number, and tap it 7 times, or until it says "You are now a Developer". Then, go back to the main Settings screen and scroll once again to the bottom. Select Developer options and enable USB Debugging. 

Then plug in your phone into your computer and hit the large green play button at the top of Android Studio. It will load for a moment before prompting you to select which device to install it on. Select your device from the list, and hit continue.

Enjoy!
